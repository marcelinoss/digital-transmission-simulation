# digital-transmission-simulation
Simulation of digital transmissions using PSK, QPSK, O-QPSK and pi/4-QPSK modulations:

In each script, one modulation techniques is simulated. The bits are randomly generated. So, the symbols are codificated and the signal eaveform are computed.

The bits, symbols and signal waveform are plotted in a iterative way to simulate the transmissiom.

Also, the decision_regions function is used to plot the constellation diagram.

These scripts were developed using MATLAB R2015a.
